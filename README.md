design.  It attempts to balance displaying enough pertinent information with a
clean aesthetic.

Installation
------------

Simply extract the zip file onto the root of your iPod Mini's hard drive.  The
.rockbox folder in it contains the appropriate folder/file structure so that
everything should end up in the right place.  

It requires the Rockbox Font Pack for the included Helvetica font.  You can
find the latest font pack [here](http://www.rockbox.org/download/byhand.cgi).

If you prefer an icon-only display of volume and battery life, see the comments
in .rockbox/wps/sprocket.wps to see how to change this.
